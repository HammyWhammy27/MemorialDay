    <h1>Memorial Day</h1>
      <h3>My Definition</h3>
    <p>Memorial Day is when we remember the soliders who fought for us during the war. In fact Memorial Day was first
        called Decoration Day.
        Also the World Wars turned it into a generalized day of remembrance instead of just for the Civil War. And alot
        of the volunteers want them to have </p>

        <h3>What is Memorial Day?</h3>
    <p>Memorial Day is an American holiday, observed on the last Monday of May, honoring the men and women who died
        while serving in the U.S. military. Memorial Day 2022 will occur on Monday, May 30.
        Originally known as Decoration Day, it originated in the years following the Civil War and became an official
        federal holiday in 1971. Many Americans observe Memorial Day by visiting cemeteries or memorials, holding family
        gatherings and participating in parades. Unofficially, it marks the beginning of the summer season.</p>
